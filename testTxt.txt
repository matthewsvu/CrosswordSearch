# Here is the complete word search puzzle for the
# Comedy Movies puzzle. Note that it is larger than
# the file I distributed with the homework assignment,
# so you should be able to find many more movies in this one.
# You might test this file with your homework to see
# what results you get. I believe you should find most of
# the movies, but there are three that you won't find. The
# "zzzzz" on is in there just for test purposes to see what
# your program does when it can't find a particular movie.

zzzz

# And here's one little palindrome for testing. It's a movie
# title not of a comedy but of a very famous robot movie.

# on whether you check for more than one existence of a movie.
